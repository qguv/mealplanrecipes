For coffee drinkers, especially those of us in Williamsburg, the combination of summer heat and Virginia humidity can make hot coffee difficult to enjoy. Taking a nice, tall glass of iced coffee to-go can make the walk from Sadler to Morton that much more bearable.

The obstacle to overcome here is the plastic glasses in Sadler. Hot coffee will melt the sides. To-go cups are worse; putting coffee in the thin, clear polypropylene cups yields a hot gob of plastic and a mess of coffee inadvertently sacrificed to [fallen Juggalos][juggalos].

The solution? _The intermediate cup._

## Method

1. Fill to-go and coffee cup completely with ice.
2. Pour coffee onto ice in coffee cup.
3. Pour contents of cup into glass, holding back remaining ice in coffee cup with a lid.
4. Repeat from (2) until glass is full.
