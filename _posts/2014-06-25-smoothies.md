Making smoothies is ridiculously easy, as long as you have access to a blender and a freezer. When in Sadler, all you need to do is spirit away some key ingredients to-go.

## Fruit

Fruit is the main ingredient. You can start with fresh fruit or fruit from a can&mdash;just cut into tiny pieces and store in a freezer-safe container (basically anything that isn't glass). Keep in mind you'll need to separate the frozen chunks later on, so draining any liquid or juice is a good idea to keep it from freezing into a blob.

  - Bananas are full of good and healthy stuff, and they give a creamy texture to any smoothie. They can be frozen or fresh; as long as the other ingredients are frozen or cold, it won't matter.
  - Melons have a nice, sweet, summery flavor. They're best blended into a smoothie on their own or with other fruit, but not with milk or yogurt.
  - Oranges are great for a tangy citrus taste, but aren't at their best when mixed with milk or yogurt.
  - Apples can be surprisingly good in a smoothie, whether in the form of apple juice, apple sauce, or fresh or frozen apples. Just remember that apples brown when exposed to the air (a coating of lemon juice helps protect them) and that the skins can be a little tough. You might want to peel your apple before using it in a smoothie.
  - All berries are delicious in smoothies, and can be mixed with a juice base, yogurt, or milk.
  - Pineapple, mango, and other tropical fruits may be hard to obtain, but tropical smoothies are immensely popular and easy to make.
  - Kiwis are great little bundles of deliciousness and nutrients as well! Technically you can eat the fuzzy skin, but for smooth blending, it's best to remove it.

## Liquid base

The liquid portion is equally important. You can try to grind up plain frozen fruit all you want, but pretty much nothing will happen unless you have a superblender.

  - For vegetarians, yogurt goes with almost everything and is a good source of protein.
  - For vegans, experiment with different non-dairy milks (soy milk should always be available in the dining hall, but sometimes it's worth buying your own alternative like almond milk or coconut milk). Soy milk is also a great source of protein&mdash;almond milk not so much, unless you buy the protein-fortified version.
  - Fruit juice provides a delicious mix-and-match for whatever fruit you've chosen; just keep in mind that mixing juice with milk is generally not a good idea unless a specific recipe tells you to do so.

## Extras

And then the accessories. None of these are necessary, but all are fun to try!

  - If it's later in the day, try grabbing some cucumber to go with your frozen melons! It's not just a good-smelling soap&mdash;it works as a smoothie, too.
  - Peanut butter is a good source of protein (remember that it isn't _complete_, but as long as you're eating a varied diet that doesn't matter).
  - Why not use chocolate soy milk instead of plain or vanilla? Chocolate pretty much goes with everything.
  - If you're feeling decadent, you can add crumbled cookies, brownies, or other treats to give your smoothie a richer, sweeter taste, or sprinkle them on top.
  - Oats or granola blend up nicely with yogurt or soy milk based smoothies and are another good source of fiber.
  - A lot of people are a fan of green smoothies, so grab whatever you like from the salad bar (although I don't recommend mushrooms or olives) and add it fresh to your smoothie! Carrots and spinach taste surprisingly good mixed up with sweeter smoothie ingredients.
