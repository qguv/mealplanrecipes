It's not right to [require][] William and Mary freshman and others living on-campus to sign up for a meal plan.
We want to give students who love to cook or have special dietary needs the option of cooking up their own meals using ingredients from dining halls.

Grab a to-go box and get cooking!

## Activism

- [F<small>ORKS</small>][forks], a potluck club that discusses "issues with the food industry," is generally against compulsory meal plans.
- We're looking to start a petition to make meal plans optional again. Contact me through our submission email (at the bottom of the page)
- You can try to get out of the compulsory meal plan program by submitting a [personal release petition][]. Special circumstances are generally required.
